Dave is a full-stack developer, tinkerer, caffeine enthusiast, and car nut from the Midwest. He also thinks it's weird to write a bio page in the third person.

I like to play with code, so I've made this little site to document my journey from script kiddie to script adult. I'm not too sure what I'll put here yet, but it'll likely be an amalgam of code articles, philosophical musings, things about my cars, and whatever else.

The inspiration is from Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World.
