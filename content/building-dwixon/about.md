This website was built with GatsbyJS, which is a bundler of sorts for all sorts of javascript frameworks.

It uses Typescript, GraphQL, Webpack, Babel, React, and a whole handful of other libraries to get the job done.  These articles are being parsed from raw markdown, and this whole static site is being served via AWS S3.  All of these technologies collectively have hundreds of years of development time.  The result is that I can spin up a little blog in an afternoon.

But do I really understand what's going on?  And more importantly -- do I need to?

In high school math, we had to learn how the building blocks fit together.  The quadratic formula, exponents, fractions, trigonometry, and later, calculus.  It was a cumulative approach to educating teenagers, hoping that they'd one day become engineers, or accountants.  The whole time, there were TI-83 calculators sitting on our desks, more than capable of crunching all the numbers.  But if we had used them, instead of learning the fundamentals -- the class wouldn't have been valuable.  It was about the journey, not the destination.

Some of those ideas can be applied to software development.  We have the calculator -- this site was mostly auto-generated, with a few minor tweaks.  So I've arrived at the destination, but what have I learned along the way?  Could I build this from scratch if I wanted to?  There is the argument that in the world of software, the destination is much more important than the journey.  At the end of the day, your goal is to fulfill a need for your end users.  Maybe that means you don't need to know how it works, as long as it gets the job done.  

If you were looking for some solid take-away from this blurb, I'm sorry to disappoint.  It's just an interesting question -- how far can we abstract the means from the end goals?
